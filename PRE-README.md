# Laundry Management System

## Step 1: Requirement Gathering and Analysis

### 1. Business Goals:
- Primary objective of the system.
- Expected outcomes (e.g., efficiency, reporting improvements).

### 2. Users and Roles:
- User types and roles.
- Permissions for each role.

### 3. Core Features:
- Production tracking (how, what to track).
- Inventory management (what to track, how to track availability).
- Client management (details to store, contracts, orders).
- Order management (how orders are created, tracked, and fulfilled).
- Invoicing and payments (generation, tracking, overdue handling).
- Reporting (types of reports, frequency).

### 4. Data and Workflows:
- Data flow (interaction between entities).
- Workflow (how orders flow through the system).

### 5. Functional and Non-Functional Requirements:
- Performance, scalability, security needs.
- Integration with any third-party systems.

### 6. Additional Features:
- Mobile support (if applicable).
- APIs or external integration.


## Step 2: System Design and Architecture Planning

### 1. Technology Stack Selection:
- Backend technology (e.g., Flask/Next.js).
- Database choices (relational vs non-relational).
- Other services: reporting tools (Streamlit), authentication, cloud services.

### 2. High-Level Architecture:
- Interaction between frontend, backend, and databases.
- Data flow between components (e.g., client orders, production, invoicing).

### 3. Database Schema:
- Define tables, collections, or entities.
- Relationships between data (e.g., clients, orders, inventory).

### 4. External Integrations:
- Any third-party tools or services the system will connect to (e.g., accounting software).

## Step 3: Prototyping and Wireframing

### 1. Wireframes of Key Screens:
- UI layout for the production dashboard, order management, reporting views, etc.

### 2. User Journey and Experience:
- Define the interaction flow for different user types (production staff, finance, management).

## Step 4: Technical Feasibility and Risk Assessment

### 1. Feasibility of Technology Stack:
- Assess whether selected tools and services meet requirements (e.g., Google Cloud services).

### 2. Risk Identification:
- Performance bottlenecks, cost implications, and security concerns.
- Plan for data protection, compliance (GDPR, etc.).

## Step 5: Milestone Planning and Project Roadmap

### 1. Define Project Phases:
- Breaking the project into logical phases (e.g., Phase 1: Order management, Phase 2: Reporting).
   
### 2. Set Timelines and Responsibilities:
- Set clear deliverables and deadlines for each phase.

## Step 6: Data Migration Planning

### 1. Identify Legacy Data:
- Assess existing systems or data sources (e.g., spreadsheets, databases).

### 2. Data Import Plan:
- Map old data to the new schema.
- Create scripts or tools to facilitate data import.

## Step 7: Create Test Plans

### 1. Unit Testing:
- For backend APIs (e.g., order creation, invoicing).
   
### 2. Integration Testing:
- Ensure smooth interaction between frontend, backend, and databases.

### 3. User Acceptance Testing:
- Full end-to-end testing from the user's perspective.
